       <h2>EDUCATION</h2>
       
      <p>I began my studies at Peo Nursery situated in Gaborone Botswana and there after continued with my primary at Thornhill Primary.
          My primary school experience was quite a bumpy ride due to the fact that I transferred from school to school quite a number of
          times! After having finished at Thornhill Primary I joined Rainbow Highschool, it was a great experience especially being in
          a new environment with much older kids. I finally finished my secondary studies in 2018 at Braeside Highschool.

          <p>
              After having finished Highschool I joined Alliance Francaise, Nairobi where i then majored in the French language.
              I am now a sowftware development student at Moringa School. I would also like to advance my studies in the 
              Achitectural field in the near future!
          </p><br><br>

       <h2>FUTURE GOALS</h2>
       <p>
          I once had a dream of becoming a pilot and from that moment on I set my mind and strived towards acheiving what was
          once said impossible for women to do. I have not had much parental support related to that course but I aspire to
          study aviation after having finished my first degree!
