        <h2>CULINARY ARTS</h2>
        <p>Cooking is an activity that I love and enjoy doing! According to me food is one element that brings people together 
            and it makes me happy to see my family and friends unite over good food made by me.
        </p><br><br>
        <h2>DANCE</h2>
        <p>I began dancing at the age of three at a Royal Ballet school and from that moment on i discovered my love for the 'sport'! 
            Dance is one of the things that make me happy no matter what mood I'm in. I enjoying breaking it down to afrobeat music
            the most but i still am and will always be a ballerina.
